# README #

**Infobar-ng** is a plugin for the [DeaDBeeF audio player](http://deadbeef.sourceforge.net/) allowing to:

* View the lyrics for the current track
* Get the biography for the artist of the current track
* Find the simular artist

It is based on [deadbeef-infobar](https://bitbucket.org/dsimbiriatin/deadbeef-infobar/wiki/Home) created by @dsimbiriatin, adding a few minor changes.

### How do I install it? ###

If you are using Arch Linux, you can [install it from the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/pkgbase/deadbeef-plugin-infobar-ng-hg/).
If not, you can just clone the repository, run `make` and then copy the *.so files to /usr/lib/deadbeef.
